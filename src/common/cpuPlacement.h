// Where the emulator's threads run (KYTY_CPU_RESERVE).
//
// The command processor (CP) is the frame's critical path. In U54 its SMT sibling was busy 21.7% of
// the time, mostly with guest job threads, and a woken CP often waited for a CPU.
//
// KYTY_CPU_RESERVE=off (default): nothing changes.
// cp: the CP gets one physical core to itself, both logical processors, through Windows CPU sets
// (SetThreadSelectedCpuSets). Every other thread of the process keeps off that core through the
// process default CPU sets: guest threads, draw-prep workers, service and completion threads, the
// CP recorder, and driver threads alike.
// cp+recorder: the CP recorder thread (KYTY_CP_RECORDER=1) gets a second core the same way.
//
// Details:
// - The allowed processors are read at runtime: the process affinity mask (Process Lasso pins
//   Astro Bot to 0-15, the V-cache CCD) and any process default CPU sets.
// - Only whole cores, every logical processor allowed, are reserved. They are chosen in the last
//   level cache that holds most allowed processors, by SchedulingClass (the CPPC preference),
//   avoiding the core of logical processor 0 (interrupts). KYTY_CPU_RESERVE_CORE=<logical
//   processor> picks the CP's core instead.
// - Reservation is skipped (and logged) when fewer than 6 logical processors would remain.
// - A monitor thread re-applies the layout when the process affinity changes (Process Lasso sets it
//   after the process has started), checking once a second.
// - CPU sets never override a hard thread affinity (SetThreadAffinityMask). Kyty sets none: guest
//   pthread affinities are only stored. The monitor scans the process's threads every 5 s for one
//   anyway (drivers, overlays): a hard affinity that meets the general processors is already
//   narrowed to them by the CPU sets; one confined to the reserved cores runs there regardless.
//   KYTY_CPU_RESERVE_REPIN=1 moves such threads to the general processors (default: counted and
//   logged only).
//
// KYTY_CPU_SETS=<logical processors of group 0> (default unset: no restriction), e.g. 16-31 or
// 0-7,16-23: every thread of the process runs on these processors (within the affinity mask),
// through the process default CPU sets, a soft affinity. With KYTY_CPU_RESERVE the CP's core is
// chosen among them and the other threads get the rest of them. Unlike a process affinity mask,
// Process Lasso's affinity rule does not reset it.
// KYTY_CPU_RESERVE_REASSERT=1 (default off): the monitor also checks once a second whether another
// process replaced the process default CPU sets this module applied, and applies its layout again.
// Process Lasso's CPU-set rule (SetProcessDefaultCpuSets, about 0.6 s after the process starts)
// otherwise silently undoes KYTY_CPU_RESERVE and KYTY_CPU_SETS for every thread but the CP and the
// recorder: they keep their thread-selected sets, so the CP stays confined to its core while other
// threads run there again. Without KYTY_CPU_SETS the other process's sets become the constraint the
// layout is computed in (Process Lasso's (0-31) leaves it unchanged).
//
// Placement samples, with the profiler's aggregates, the hang trace or
// KYTY_CPU_PLACEMENT_SAMPLES=1: the CP, the recorder, guest threads, draw-prep workers and service
// threads note where they run.
// - FrameEvents: CpuPlacement{Cp,Guest,Host}Samples; CpuPlacementCpOffCore and
//   CpuPlacementRecorderOffCore (outside their reserved cores); CpuPlacement{Guest,Host}OnCpCore
//   (on the physical core of the CP's latest sample: SMT sharing); CpuPlacementHardAffinity
//   (threads found with a hard affinity other than the process's), CpuPlacementHardAffinityReserved
//   (of those, confined to reserved cores), CpuPlacementRepinned.
// - Hang trace: placement.csv, samples per role and logical processor each second.
