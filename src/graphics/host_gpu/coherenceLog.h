// Draw-prep S4: the coherence generation and its range log.
//
// Every transition that can change whether a guest range is clean for a GPU-backing read, or
// which copy of it is authoritative (buffer GPU-dirty ranges, backing publications, image GPU
// ownership, tracker GPU bits, GPU map/unmap), appends one entry {generation, [begin, end),
// source} BEFORE its state change becomes observable (the same point that retires cached clean
// verdicts, see cleanVerdictCache.h). Emulator writes of backing bytes outside a publication
// (occlusion and LOD-statistics results) append AFTER the bytes are written. A transition whose
// range is unknown appends a universe entry.
//
// The generation is the clean-verdict generation: CleanVerdict::Invalidate() appends here.
// Entries are always recorded (LogReadersEnabled).
//
// Readers (the draw-prep certificate check on the GPU thread) ask whether any entry in the
// generation interval (g0, g1] intersects a set of ranges. The log is a ring: an interval that
// is older than the ring, or an entry whose writer has not finished yet, answers Unknown, which
// callers treat like a conflict. Answers are therefore conservative, never optimistic.
