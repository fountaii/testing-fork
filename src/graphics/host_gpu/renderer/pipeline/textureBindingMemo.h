struct TextureBinding;

// Texture binding identity memo (KYTY_TEXTURE_BINDING_MEMO, default on; =0 restores the full
// resolution for every binding).
//
// RenderExecutor::ResolveTexture turns (T# dwords, shader image resource) into a texture-cache
// image and a description, and RebindImages turns that into the sampled view. Both repeat for
// every bound texture of every draw although the answer rarely changes. This memo remembers, per
// exact key (the eight T# dwords plus every ImageResource field the resolution reads), the final
// description, the image FindImage returned and the view FindTexture returned.
//
// When a memoized answer is exact:
//  - FindImage. Only answers of the first-page lookup are recorded: after the slow resolution,
//    FindImageWithSameBacking(final description) must return the same image and FindImage must
//    not have rebased the view (mip/slice-of-a-larger-image answers are never recorded; DCC
//    descriptions are recorded only with KYTY_CP_COMMIT=texdcc, together with the certificate of
//    MaterializeDccClear's decision, which inspects guest metadata on every lookup; a hit checks
//    it). That lookup reads only the owner list of the description's first 1 MiB page, the
//    owners' registered flags and SameBacking fields, which are fixed for an image's lifetime.
//    Owner lists and registered flags change only in TextureCache::RegisterImage/
//    UnregisterImage (every creation, free, expansion, overlap resolution, depth recreate,
//    residency change, idle/garbage/pressure collection and unmap goes through them), which
//    bump the structure version of every page the image covers (TextureCache::PageVersion). An
//    entry is used only while its first page's version is unchanged, so FindImage would return
//    the recorded image again.
//  - FindImage side effects. SyncAliasFromOwner must be a no-op: either the image is its alias
//    owner (checked live) or no other registered image has the same backing range, extent and
//    sample count (checked once when recording, over the first-page owners; such partners start
//    on that page, so they appear only with a new version). The tick/LRU touch is performed
//    exactly as FindImage does. A stencil association (depth_id, checked live; attaching one also
//    bumps the page versions) or a pending rebind (checked live) takes the slow path.
//  - Resident mip levels. FindImage and FindTexture call EnsureResidency with the first level
//    the view can sample (TextureCache::RequestedFirstLevel of the description: base level plus
//    MIN_LOD for sampled views, 0 for storage). The memo records that level and uses an entry
//    only while the image's resident_first is at most it (checked live), so EnsureResidency
//    would do nothing; an extension re-registers the image, which also bumps the page versions.
//  - FindTexture (sampled bindings only; storage bindings always take the slow path because they
//    mark the image GPU-written). RefreshImage must be a no-op: the image is not CPU-dirty,
//    maybe-dirty or buffer-modified, and TrackImage has nothing to do (the resident range is
//    watched as a whole, or, when chunk-tracked, watched with no released chunk); it has no
//    stencil plane to refresh. Views are never destroyed or replaced while their image lives
//    and FindView returns the first view matching the normalized info, so the recorded view of
//    the same image id (slot generation included) is what FindView returns.
// All image state is read under the texture-cache lock. The guest write-fault fast path skips
// that lock only for pages on which no image is registered, so it never changes an image the
// memo can answer for.
// Null descriptors resolve to the texture cache's permanent null images (never registered, never
// freed); their entries do not depend on page versions.
