// Upload DMA (KYTY_UPLOAD_DMA, default on; needs a transfer-only queue family and is off under
// RenderDoc). CPU-dirty buffer uploads are staged in the host upload ring and copied into the
// device-local cache buffers by the graphics queue, which reads the staged bytes over PCIe: about
// 80 us/MB on the RTX 3090 (Gen3 x16, no resizable BAR), 20 MB and 1.3-1.6 ms of graphics-queue
// time per Sky Garden frame in the U49 capture (one per-frame 16 MB buffer alone 1.2 ms).
//
// Stage() moves the PCIe part to the copy engine: it reserves room in a device-local ring and
// queues a transfer-queue copy of the staged bytes into it. A worker submits the queued copies in
// batches, each signalling a timeline semaphore; the graphics copy then reads the ring (VRAM to
// VRAM) and the guest scheduler's submission that contains it waits for the semaphore value at
// the transfer stage (SubmitDependency). The data and the command order of the graphics copies
// are unchanged; only where the host bytes cross the bus changes.
//
// Ring space is reused only after the guest tick that recorded the reading copy has completed
// (that tick's submission waited for the transfer, so the transfer is complete too); a transfer
// batch that writes reused space also waits on the master semaphore for those ticks, so the
// ordering is explicit on the device. A full ring (or an upload below KYTY_UPLOAD_DMA_MIN_KB)
// keeps the graphics-queue copy from the host ring.
//
// KYTY_UPLOAD_DMA_MB (default 64): ring size. KYTY_UPLOAD_DMA_MIN_KB (default 64): smallest upload
// moved to the copy engine (small copies are latency bound; the semaphore wait would cost more).
[[nodiscard]] bool UploadDmaRequested();
// KYTY_UPLOAD_DMA_VERIFY=1: every staged upload also copies its ring bytes, in the recording that
// reads them, into a host-visible buffer; at completion they are compared with a snapshot of the
// staged host bytes taken when the copy was queued (UploadDmaVerifyChecks / UploadDmaVerifyMismatches
// and a log line). The copy ends the active rendering instance, so verify runs are for correctness.
[[nodiscard]] bool UploadDmaVerify();
// KYTY_UPLOAD_DMA_HOST_COPY (default on; =0: the command processor copies as before). A staged
// read upload's guest bytes are copied into the host staging ring by the DMA worker, just before
// it submits the transfer that reads them, instead of by the command processor. The worker reads
// them through the direct-memory backing alias (LibKernel::Memory::GuestBackingAlias), which
// never faults whatever protection the tracker or the guest gives the guest view meanwhile.
// Order and data are those of the command-processor copy: the pages were made clean and
// write-protected before the copy is queued (MemoryTracker::ForEachUploadRange), so a guest write
// after that point faults and makes them CPU-dirty again for the next upload, whether the copy
// reads the bytes before or after it (a write racing the draws, as with the command-processor
// copy made right after the protection). The graphics copies that read the staged bytes run in a
// submission that waits for the transfer (PendingValue), which the worker submits after the
// host copies. Ranges without an alias (not direct memory, or spanning mappings) are copied by
// the command processor as before.
