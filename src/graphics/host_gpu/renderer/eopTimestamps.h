// GPU-accurate guest timestamps (KYTY_EOP_TIMESTAMPS).
//
// The guest samples the GPU clock with end-of-pipe events: RELEASE_MEM or EVENT_WRITE_EOP with the
// clock data select. On hardware the value is the time the GPU finished everything before the
// packet. Kyty writes such a timestamp, like every label, when the command processor records the
// packet, so the deltas the guest computes measure recording time. Astro Bot's dynamic resolution
// controller (eboot 0x73e5060) compares those deltas, from its GPU timer rings, with a 16.67 ms
// budget. So when the command processor is fast it raises the resolution whatever the GPU costs.
//
// record (default): unchanged.
// gpu:
// - Every such timestamp is still written with its record-time value at once. Labels, fences and
//   their order are untouched.
// - A timestamp query is also recorded at the same point of the command buffer.
// - Once its tick has completed, the command processor rewrites the slot with the query's time,
//   converted to the guest clock. It does so at its next clock write, where the draw-prep window
//   is empty, unless the guest has written the slot since.
// - A timestamp deferred with its label (TryDeferLabel) gets the converted value from the deferred
//   write instead.
// - The command processor never waits: an unavailable result or slot keeps the record-time value.
// gpu-verify: gpu, and each published value is checked against its record-time value (the GPU
// cannot finish before the packet was recorded) and against the previously published value (the
// single host queue executes in recording order).
//
// COPY_DATA from the clock reads it when the command processor processes the packet, on hardware as
// here, and stays at record time.
