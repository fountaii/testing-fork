// KYTY_DRAW_RUN (default 0 = off): run-level commit of consecutive draws that share their
// structure (Profiling analysis: cp-batching-report.md).
//
// At the Sky Garden start view about 55% of the committed draws continue the previous draw: the
// same rendering instance, registers (apart from the per-draw index offset and object id),
// programs, T# and S# words. Only per-draw data differs (V# buffers, user data, flattened SRT,
// index/vertex buffers, counts). Such a draw is committed as a delta of the run it continues:
//  - its programs are validated (DrawPrep::Validate) and all per-draw data is resolved, uploaded
//    and bound as for any draw (shader data, V# buffers, BDA, index/vertex buffers, descriptors,
//    push constants), in the same order;
//  - the structure is not resolved again: colour/depth target resolution, texture and sampler
//    resolution and views, the pipeline lookup, attachment acquisition (AcquireRenderTargets),
//    image layout transitions and dynamic state are those of the previous draw.
// A continuation is taken only while the run's certificate holds:
//  - the previous committed draw recorded through this path's eligible shape: one vertex stage,
//    no mesh or indirect draw, no shader writes, GDS or attachment feedback, no attachment clear
//    in its rendering state, its preparation validated;
//  - nothing else ran on the command processor since (DrawRun::ActivityEpoch: every operation other
//    than a committed draw, service commands and ready operations advance it), the command buffer,
//    its tick and the rendering instance are still the previous draw's;
//  - the draw's structure key equals the previous draw's (DrawRun::StructureKey, computed by the
//    preparing thread: every context register, the user-config registers but the index offset and
//    object id, the programs, the T# and S# words), as do its render-target slice offset;
//  - after the draw's buffer discovery and binding (which can download images for texel reads,
//    submit, or create buffers), every image the reused structure refers to (the textures of both
//    stages and the attachments) still has the identity and state (native image, registration,
//    rebind flag, residency, layout, access, stage, dirtiness, content serial) it had when the
//    previous draw finished, and the tick is unchanged. Otherwise the draw resolves its structure
//    the normal way at that point (and binds its buffers again after it).
// Everything a continuation skips is a function of those inputs and of that image state, and the
// previous draw left every skipped transition, claim and binding in the state they establish; its
// skipped side effects (LRU touches, content-identity bumps of the attachments, repeated claims)
// have no observer between the two draws. A guest CPU write racing the draws (another thread)
// changes nothing a draw of the same command buffer could rely on.
//
// KYTY_DRAW_RUN=1: continuations take the delta path.
// KYTY_DRAW_RUN=verify|exit: every draw takes the normal path; for each draw that would have been a
// continuation, what the delta path would have reused is compared with what the normal path
// computed (targets, texture bindings and views, samplers, pipeline, rendering state, barrier
// safety, shader writes), and the normal path's skipped work must have been a no-op (no image
// transition recorded, no dynamic state emitted, no attachment state changed but content serials
// and LRU marks). Differences are counted, the first N logged (KYTY_DRAW_RUN_LOG_LIMIT, default 64) ("exit" stops at the first).
// One console line every 10 s: "DrawRun 10s: ...".
