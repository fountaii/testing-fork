// KYTY_CP_COMMIT_STATS=1 (diagnostic, default off): where the command processor's time goes when it
// commits a draw (DrawPrep::Engine::Commit), phase by phase, measured with the TSC, and how much of
// it a run-level commit or a cross-frame reuse could skip. Nothing it measures feeds back into
// emulation; with the switch unset every hook is one predictable branch.
//
// Every committed draw that records a draw command is classified against the previous one:
//  - continuation: same rendering instance (no end, split or barrier flush in between), pipeline,
//    programs, attachments, texture views/layouts, samplers and dynamic state, and the previous
//    draw had no shader buffer writes. Only per-draw data differs (V# buffers, user data, SRT
//    tables, index/vertex buffers, counts): a draw a run-level commit could record as a delta.
//  - start: the first draw of such a run.
// Draws that return before recording (no targets, metadata operations) count as "other".
// Cross-frame (frames start at the graphics processor reset after sceAgcSuspendPoint): the share
// of draws whose complete binding inputs (every stage's V#/T#/S# words, flattened SRT, user data,
// draw arguments) occurred in the previous frame or the one before (exact reuse), and the same for
// their structure (programs, pipeline, attachments, T#, S#, V# words without base addresses).
// One console line every 10 s (flushed), "CommitStats 10s: ...".
