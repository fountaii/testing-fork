// Draw-prep S5/S6: prepare-then-commit for direct draws.
//
// KYTY_DRAW_PREP=off (default): nothing here runs; the command processor executes draws exactly
// as before.
// KYTY_DRAW_PREP=inline (S5): each direct draw snapshots the registers, is prepared on the
// command processor (GPU) thread from that snapshot with every guest read recorded, and is then
// committed: the command buffer reads the snapshot, the certificate is checked where the serial
// path would call GetGraphicsPrograms, and the prepared programs are used when it holds (the
// serial preparation runs otherwise). This is the whole protocol without threads.
// KYTY_DRAW_PREP=parallel (S6): the command processor keeps parsing while DrawPrep workers
// prepare the published draws of a window; packets that could change what a later draw reads
// (fences) first commit the whole window in guest order.
//
// KYTY_DRAW_PREP_VERIFY=1|exit: after every committed preparation the serial preparation runs
// on copies and the outputs are compared (logged and counted; "exit" stops on a difference).
// KYTY_DRAW_PREP_CERT=log (default)|value: see Validate() in drawPrep.cpp.
// KYTY_DRAW_PREP_CERT_RANGES=worker (default)|commit: where the coherence-log check's merged
// certificate ranges are built (ReadSet::BuildCertificate). "worker": by the preparing thread,
// once, after the read set is finished; "commit": by the command processor in Validate, as
// before (0.41 ms/flip of CP time at the Sky Garden start, U55). The list is a pure function of
// the finished read set either way. KYTY_DRAW_PREP_CERT_RANGES_VERIFY=1|exit rebuilds it at
// commit with the commit-time function and compares (DrawPrepCertRangesVerify* events).
// KYTY_DRAW_PREP_WORKERS (default 6, 1..32), KYTY_DRAW_PREP_WINDOW (default 32 slots, rounded
// up to a power of two), KYTY_DRAW_PREP_SPIN_US (default 200: how long an idle hot worker spins
// before parking): parallel mode only.
// KYTY_DRAW_PREP_HOT (default 2): workers that spin like that; the others park as soon as nothing
// is claimable and are woken, one at a time, when KYTY_DRAW_PREP_WAKE_BACKLOG (default 2; 8 until
// U54) published slots wait unclaimed; a woken one spins KYTY_DRAW_PREP_COLD_SPIN_US (default 50)
// before parking again (workerGate.h). KYTY_DRAW_PREP_HOT >= KYTY_DRAW_PREP_WORKERS keeps every
// worker hot, the behaviour before the gate.
// KYTY_DRAW_PREP_STEAL (default 0 = off): N >= 1 lets the command processor, while a worker holds
// the head slot it must commit, prepare later unclaimed slots itself, exactly as a worker does,
// as long as at least N slots wait unclaimed; KYTY_DRAW_PREP_STEAL_AFTER_US (default 0) first
// spins that long on the held head (Engine::CommitHead, workerGate.h AwaitHead).
// KYTY_DRAW_PREP_HISTOGRAM=1: the S0 draws-per-fence histogram also in off mode (the packet
// classification runs, nothing else changes).
