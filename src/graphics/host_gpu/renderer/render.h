// directly before the next command that may access memory:
//   - Handle(): every native recording site obtains the handle through it, so the pending
//     batch is recorded (ending an active rendering instance first) before anything the caller
//     records. StateHandle() is the exception for state-only commands (binds, dynamic state,
//     push constants/descriptors), which barriers do not order.
//   - BeginRendering(): the draw path records its draw right after it.
//   - End() / scheduler submission.
// Consecutive requests with nothing recorded between them are merged (the union of their
// scopes is at least as strong as the sequence). A memory request is elided when nothing was
// recorded since the previous flushed barrier and that barrier's memory dependency covers it.
// KYTY_BARRIER_SINK (default on, needs the batcher) additionally keeps a pending memory-only
// batch across a draw that continues the same rendering instance when the draw is proven
// hazard-free with respect to everything since the last full barrier; see
// CommandBuffer::CanSinkPending() for the exact conditions.
// KYTY_DRAW_WRITE_SINK (default on, needs the batcher): the shader-write barrier a draw with guest
// storage-buffer writes requests after itself no longer ends the rendering instance. It stays
// pending while later draws continue the same instance and is recorded at the next flush point
// (another instance, any Handle() command, End()). Guest-visible ordering between draws is what
// the GPU provides: none for shader storage accesses unless the guest synchronizes (PS/VS/CS
// partial flushes and cache actions become Guest requests, which are never sunk this way), so
// draws of one instance may overlap as they do on the hardware. Every non-draw consumer is still
// ordered after the writes. KYTY_DRAW_WRITE_SINK=0 ends the instance after such draws again.
// KYTY_UPLOAD_BATCH (default on, needs the batcher): CPU-dirty buffer uploads are queued with
// CommandBuffer::RequestUploadCopy and recorded at the next flush point as ONE barrier for all
// destination buffers, the copies, and their post-copy barriers merged into the batch being
